Advanced Python Scheduler (APScheduler) is a light but powerful in-process task
scheduler that lets you schedule jobs (functions or any python callables) to be
executed at times of your choosing.

This can be a far better alternative to externally run cron scripts for
long-running applications (e.g. web applications), as it is platform neutral
and can directly access your application's variables and functions.

The development of APScheduler was heavily influenced by the `Quartz
<http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/>`_ task scheduler written in Java.
APScheduler provides most of the major features that Quartz does, but it also
provides features not present in Quartz (such as multiple job stores).


Features
========

* No (hard) external dependencies
* Thread-safe API
* Excellent test coverage (tested on CPython 2.5 - 2.7, 3.2 - 3.3, Jython 2.5.3, PyPy 2.2)
* Configurable scheduling mechanisms (triggers):

  * Cron-like scheduling
  * Delayed scheduling of single run jobs (like the UNIX "at" command)
  * Interval-based (run a job at specified time intervals)
* Multiple, simultaneously active job stores:

  * RAM 
  * File-based simple database (shelve)
  * `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_ (any supported RDBMS works)
  * `MongoDB <http://www.mongodb.org/>`_
  * `Redis <http://redis.io/>`_
